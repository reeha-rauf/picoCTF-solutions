## 🔍 Initial Observations

- The challenge page appeared minimal, with basic information about Histiaeus.
- Based on the challenge name ("Inspect HTML"), I suspected the flag was hidden in the source code.
- Immediately opened DevTools to begin inspection.

## 🧪 Exploitation Steps

1. Right-clicked the page → Inspect to open DevTools.
2. Navigated to the Elements tab.
3. Expanded each tag to explore the DOM.
4. Found the flag inside an HTML comment (`<!-- ... -->`) located after a `<p>` tag.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Flags can be hidden in plain sight — especially inside HTML comments, which aren’t visible in the rendered page but can be easily viewed using browser DevTools.
- This challenge reinforced the importance of checking page source code as a first step, especially when no visible input or interaction is present.
- It’s a reminder that in real-world scenarios, developers may accidentally expose sensitive data in comments or forgotten test code.
