## 🧩 Challenge Description

Can you get the flag?

Hint 1: Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

---

## 🔍 Initial Observations

- The webpage displayed basic content, with no visible flag in the HTML.
- The challenge hint suggested that not all code is immediately visible in the inspector, implying the use of external files.
- Opened the DevTools → Sources tab to investigate included resources.

---

## 🧪 Exploitation Steps

1. Opened DevTools and navigated to the Sources tab.

2. Noticed three included files:
    - `index.html`
    - `script.js`
    - `style.css`
3. Searched each file individually:
    - First half of the flag was found in a comment in `style.css`
    - Second half of the flag was hidden in `script.js`
4. Combined the two halves to reconstruct the full flag.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Webpages can reference external files (`.css`, `.js`, etc.) that may contain critical data.
- The Elements tab only shows the final rendered HTML; the Sources tab reveals the full structure and contents of all loaded files.
- Sensitive information should never be stored in frontend-accessible files, even if it's hidden in stylesheets or scripts.
