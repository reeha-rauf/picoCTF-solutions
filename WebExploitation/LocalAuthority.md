## 🧩 Challenge Description

Can you get the flag?

Hint 1: How is the password checked on this website?

---

## 🔍 Initial Observations

- The challenge involved a login form with a username and password input.
- This remineded me of a previous challenge called [IntroToBurp](WebExploitation/IntroToBurp.md)
- I used Burp Suite to intercept and inspect the site’s traffic.

## 🧪 Exploitation Steps

1. Opened Burp Suite and navigated to the challenge page using the built-in browser.
2. Filled out the login form with dummy credentials and submitted it.
3. Went to Proxy → HTTP History and reviewed the traffic.
4. Found a `POST` request for the form submission, followed by a `GET` request.
5. Inspected the `GET` request and found a JavaScript function named `checkPassword(...)` in the response.
6. The function revealed the **hardcoded** correct username and password.
7. Submitted the correct credentials manually and the flag was revealed.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Some websites perform password checks locally in JavaScript, rather than on the server. This is highly insecure because the logic (and credentials) can be inspected by anyone.

### **Vulnerabilty Summary**

| Type                           | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client-side authentication** | The login credentials were hardcoded in a JavaScript function (`checkPassword`) returned by the server. Anyone inspecting the code could retrieve them. |
| **Impact**                     | Unauthorized users can access the protected content (flag) without brute force or bypass.                                                               |
| **Countermeasures**            | Always perform authentication and password checks **on the server**, and avoid exposing secret values in JavaScript code served to the client.          |
