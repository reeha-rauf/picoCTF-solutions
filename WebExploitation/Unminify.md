## 🧩 Challenge Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

---

## 🔍 Initial Observations
- Opened the webpage and noticed the HTML was minified — all content appeared as a single compressed line of code.
- The challenge description hinted that the source code was intentionally “squished” for faster loading, which implied the flag was still present in the HTML.
- Opened DevTools (F12) and used the Elements tab to inspect and expand the HTML structure manually.

## 🧪 Exploitation Steps

1. Opened the challenge webpage and opened DevTools.
2. Navigated to the Elements tab to view the HTML structure.
3. Expanded the nested elements in the following order:
    - `<center>` tag
    - Then inside it, the first `<div>` tag
    - Then the next nested `<div>` tag
    - And a third nested `<div>` tag within that
    - Located the second `<p>` tag inside the deepest `<div>` was the flag.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Minification is the process of removing whitespace, newlines, and comments from code to reduce file size and improve load times — it doesn’t affect how the browser renders the page.
- Even though the code appears “squished” into a single unreadable line in the source view, it still forms a valid HTML structure that the browser can parse and display correctly.
- Using DevTools > Elements tab, I learned how to navigate deeply nested HTML even when it’s minified, by expanding individual tags and visually exploring the DOM tree.
- Expanding or collapsing HTML tags in DevTools has no effect on page speed — it’s just a helpful interface for developers and analysts.
- Minification improves performance because it reduces the number of bytes transferred and parsed, not because of how the HTML is structured visually or how deeply it’s nested.
