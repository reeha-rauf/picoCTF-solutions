## üß© Challenge Description

Do you know how to use the web inspector?

---

## üîç Initial Observations

- Opened the webpage and used DevTools (Web Inspector) to inspect each major section: `Home`, `About`, and `Contact`.
- Navigated to the About section and noticed a custom attribute: `<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9">`
- The value of `notify_true` looked like a Base64-encoded string, which is often used in CTFs to hide flags or messages.

## üß™ Exploitation Steps

1. Opened DevTools and inspected the About section‚Äôs HTML.
2. Found this value in the notify_true attribute: `cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9`
3. Recognized it as **Base64-encoded**, thanks to its format and padding.
4. Opened [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and pasted the string into the input.
5. The decoded string revealed the flag.

## üß† What I Learned

- The Web Inspector (DevTools) is a powerful tool for exploring the structure and attributes of a web page, including hidden values that aren‚Äôt visible in the rendered content.
- Developers can add custom HTML attributes (like notify_true) that may store important data ‚Äî and in CTFs, these often hide encoded flags.
- The value found was Base64-encoded, a common method to obscure readable text without true encryption.

### **Code Explanation**

`<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9">`

| `<section>`                                                | HTML element representing a semantic section of the webpage (in this case, the "About" section).                         |
| `class="about"`                                            | A CSS class used for styling or JavaScript targeting. Not directly relevant to the flag, but helps identify the section. |
| `notify_true="..."`                                        | A **custom attribute** (not standard HTML). Likely added for challenge purposes to hide data.                            |
| `cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9` | This value is **Base64-encoded**                                                                                         |
