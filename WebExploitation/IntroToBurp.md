## 🧩 Challenge Description

Hint 1: Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.

Hint2: Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

## 🔍 Initial Observations

- The site presented two forms:
    - The first form asked for a username, password, and other details.
    - Submitting that led to a second form that prompted for an OTP (one-time password), which always returned “invalid OTP.”
- Based on the challenge title and hint, I launched Burp Suite to intercept and inspect the form submission.

## 🧪 Exploitation Steps

1. Opened Burp Suite and used the built-in browser to access the challenge site via the given URL.
2. Submitted the first form to reach the OTP step.
3. On Burp Suite, went to Proxy → HTTP History, and found the `POST` request  that submitted the OTP.
4. Right-clicked the request → **Send to Repeater**.
5. In the Repeater tab, deleted the last line of the body: `otp=...`
6. Clicked Send — and the server responded with the flag.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Burp Suite is a powerful web security testing tool that acts as a local proxy between the browser and a web server. It allows you to intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP requests and responses in real time.
- During this challenge, I used Burp's built-in browser, the Proxy tab to capture traffic, and the Repeater tab to send modified requests — eventually bypassing a server-side OTP check and obtaining the flag.
- I learned that removing a field (like otp=...) from a request can sometimes trigger insecure server logic, especially when developers assume certain fields are always present.
- Burp Suite is a dual-use tool — while it can be used maliciously, it is widely available because:
    - Ethical hackers, students, and professionals rely on it for security testing and defense.
    - Tools like Burp help identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.
    - Transparency empowers defenders to simulate real-world attacks and build more secure systems.
- Like many cybersecurity tools, it’s not dangerous by itself — the intent and use matter more than the tool.

**Vulnerabilty Summary**

- The vulnerability exploited was a logic flaw caused by missing server-side validation. The server incorrectly assumed that if otp wasn't present in the request, the user should be granted access.
- This kind of bug arises when developers assume client-side behavior will always match expectations — a common security mistake.

**Counter Measures**

- Strict server-side validation: Ensure that all required fields (like otp) are explicitly checked. Do not rely on client-side enforcement.
- Fail securely: If a required input is missing or malformed, default to denying access — not granting it.
- Use server-side sessions to track OTP verification rather than relying on repeated client input.
- Monitor and log for missing or tampered fields to detect abuse patterns early.
