## üîç Initial Observations
- Visited the provided link and saw a web page.
- Opened DevTools (F12) and navigated to the Application > Cookies section.
- Noticed a cookie named `secret_recipe` with a long, encoded-looking value: `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ%3D%3D`
- The name `secret_recipe` and the encoding pattern suggested it might contain the flag.

## üß™ Exploitation Steps

1. Clicked on the cookie value: `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ%3D%3D`
2. Decoded it by checking the *Show URL-decoded* box in DevTools: `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ==`
3. Base64-decoded the result using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to get: `picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_AC8FCD75}`
4. That's the flag!

## üß† What I Learned

- Cookies are small data values stored in the browser and automatically sent with HTTP requests. They can store anything from session IDs to user preferences.
- Developers sometimes store sensitive information in cookies, like tokens, flags, or roles (e.g., is_admin), but this is risky ‚Äî especially if left in plain text or Base64.
- The secret_recipie cookie in this challenge was:
    - URL-encoded (%3D = =)
    - Then Base64-encoded, which decoded to the flag.

I also learned what each cookie header in DevTools represents:
| **Header**        | **What It Means**                         | **Common / Allowed Values**                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**          | Cookie key                                | Any valid string (e.g., `session_id`)       |
| **Value**         | Stored data                               | Text, JSON, tokens, Base64 (e.g., `abc123`) |
| **Domain**        | Which domain can access it                | `.example.com`, `sub.domain.com`            |
| **Path**          | URL path where the cookie is sent         | `/`, `/admin`, `/profile/settings`          |
| **Expires / Max-Age**       | Absolute expiration date        | `Wed, 21 Oct 2025 07:28:00 GMT`             |
| **Size**          | Total size in bytes                       | (Read-only, auto-calculated by browser)     |
| **HttpOnly**      | JS can‚Äôt access if `true`                 | `true` / *(blank if unset)*                 |
| **Secure**        | Only sent over HTTPS                      | `true` / *(blank if unset)*                 |
| **SameSite**      | Controls cross-site requests              | `Strict`, `Lax`, `None`                     |
| **Partition Key** | Ties cookie to site partition (isolation) | Auto-assigned by browser (not manually set) |
| **Cross-Site**    | Was this a cross-site request?            | `Yes`, `No`, `Some` (browser-managed)       |
| **Priority**      | Importance for eviction                   | `Low`, `Medium`, `High`                     |
