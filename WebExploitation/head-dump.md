## 🧩 Challenge Description
The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the server’s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.

## 🔍 Initial Observations
- The second post has a link to an API documentation to a Swagger UI

---

## 🧪 Exploitation Steps

1. Clicked the link provided in the challenge to open the Swagger-based API documentation.
2. Swagger displayed a list of available API endpoints.
3. Scrolled to the **Diagnosing** section and located the `/heapdump` endpoint.
4. Clicked "**Try it out**" → then "**Execute**".
5. Copied the **Request URL** Swagger generated and pasted it directly into the browser.
6. This triggered a download of a text file (the heap dump).
7. Opened the file in a text editor.
8. Used **Ctrl+F** to search for the word *picoCTF* and found the flag inside the memory dump.

## 🧠 What I Learned

**What is an API?**
- An API (Application Programming Interface) lets different programs talk to each other.
- It exposes endpoints (URLs) that handle specific actions, like getting data or uploading files.


**What is an API Endpoint?**
- An endpoint is a specific path on the server (e.g., `/api/flag`) that performs a function.
- Each endpoint typically supports a specific `HTTP` method like `GET`, `POST`, or `PUT`.


**What is Swagger?**
- Swagger UI is an interactive tool for viewing and testing API endpoints in your browser.
- It shows:
    - All available API routes
    - What inputs each one expects
    - What kind of data they return


**Why Swagger Can Be Dangerous**
- If left public, it may expose:
    - Sensitive or internal endpoints (like debug tools or admin routes)
    - Unprotected functions that leak data or flags


**What is a Heap Dump?**
- A heap dump is a snapshot of a program’s memory (the heap) at a moment in time.
- It may contain:
    - User sessions
    - Internal data
    - API keys, tokens
- It’s intended for internal debugging, but if exposed publicly, it can be a serious security risk.
